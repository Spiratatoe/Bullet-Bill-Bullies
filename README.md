**Description**



Back In Time is a thrilling PC game of the Metroidvania / Platformer genre , offering players a captivating journey through the corridors of time. Set in pixelated landscapes, the game unfolds across four distinct eras: Present-day, Medieval Times, the Prehistoric Age, and the enigmatic Pre-Time period. The Medieval Level and Stone Age stages introduce unique challenges, each with its own set of obstacles that players must navigate.
With a linear progression system, time-manipulating obstacles, and retro visuals, this game promises an exhilarating adventure where the consequences of time travel unravel before your eyes.

We play as Suzy, an everyday girl, who accidentally follows a time cat and is now stuck in the past and must find her way home. Suzy is brought back through time as she and the cat collect time crystals to help re-regenerate the cat's powers to get her home. Luckily the cat is able to lend Suzy its time powers to help her collect the time crystals.

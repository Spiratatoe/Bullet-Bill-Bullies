WOAH ! Where am I ? #speaker:Suzy
Suzy, why the hell did you follow me ?! #speaker:Cat
Did you just ... speak? #speaker:Suzy
How did you even get here? You were supposed to stay home!  #speaker:Cat
Well I followed you and got sucked into some garbage can portal, and how are you still speaking !  #speaker:Suzy
You really have no idea what you've gotten yourself into. I am not an ordinary cat. 
I can travel through time and right now I have a mission to complete. #speaker:Cat
Wait ? what ? you can travel through time ?! Well get me home I have school tomorrow. #speaker:Suzy
The only way back to the present is to go back in to, we can only go backward, not forward. 
I guess your just gonna have to accompany me on this mission, you might prove useful, but I warn you it won't be easy. #speaker:Cat
Mission ? Why do I have to go on it with you ? #speaker:Suzy
Time and space is delicate and beings like me protect it. An ancient malevolent entity, known as the Chronophage, is trying to devour time itself. 
Chrono-crystals hidden through time are the key in stopping the Chronophage from causing chaos and destruction. 
The Chronophage is very sensitive to time beings, such as myself. If you collect them, we could go undetected by it. #speaker:Cat
And this is the only way home ? #speaker:Suzy
It is, therefore it's immensly important for us to get the chrono-crystals. 
You can use my powers, they will be crucial for collecting the chrono-crystals and stopping the Chronophage.
What powers ?
As a time being, I am able to freeze time and also blip through space. I will lend these to you, so that you may collect the crystals. 
PRESS "E" to pause time and PRESS "SHIFT" to blip through time.
And where will how can I find the crystals ?
I have sensed the first one to be in this time period, and I believe it to be in this castle. Once you have it, we will continue on our mission.
Jeez, I'm gonna be tired for school tomorrow.

/*
The Chronophage desires the time crystals because they possess the power to manipulate and control time. These crystals can be used to alter the course of history, disrupt the balance of time, and grant the possessor immense temporal abilities. The cat needs to collect the time crystals to prevent the Chronophage from harnessing their power for destructive purposes, as the malevolent entity seeks to disrupt the very fabric of time and space, causing chaos and destruction across the ages. The crystals are the key to stopping the Chronophage and preserving the integrity of the temporal continuum.
